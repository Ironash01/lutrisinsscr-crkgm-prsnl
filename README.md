# Lutris installer scripts personal. 
My personal repo for lutris isntaller scripts for cracked games.

**Games that should work<br />**
**Take note, that the installer scripts only work for the links I got it from. Other releases might work.<br />**
**I won't bother troubleshooting much if the game is not rated that good in protondb.com or lutris.net<br />**
**setup** means you'll need to point lutris to the actual setup files of the game.
**portable** means you'll need to point lutris to the actual directory of the game.

setup will put game files under prefix and portables will not.<br />
If wine prompts you to install wine-mono or other runtimes DO IT!<br />
Let's talk about save files. Portable instance or not the location is not guaranteed.<br />
Some are relative, some are not. I'll provide pcgamingwiki pages for some games so you can see their save game location however, some games do not yet have a pcgamingwiki page. I'll put the save game location myself in that case.
